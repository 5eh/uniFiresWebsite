## Identify

In our workshops, the first step is to identify the main challenges in Web3 adoption. By sharing experiences, we pinpoint the key issues that hinder cross-chain collaboration. Identifying these problems is crucial for finding effective solutions. These conversations published, display the weak points in our ecosystems' show us what can be done better. Creating a fulcrum for the lever of improvement.

## Ideate

Once we've highlighted a few issues, we generate use cases and stories. Participants from both ecosystems share their innovative thoughts and perspectives. We document. Producing unique builder experiences and facilitating true learning. This phase is all about thinking outside the box and exploring new possibilities. Joining hands, locking eyes, playing and listening.

## Initiate

After workshops we will have a knowledge base. Our reasearch will be a nice baseline for other collaborative projects to start their activity. We want to move from theory to practice, making tangible progress in Web3 adoption. Instigating projects & connecting them with grants and builders.

Connecting people from similar fields creates the mycelium of our networks.
